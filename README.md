# NYPD-Shooting-by-Borough

In this project, I refined NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) data from Data.Gov

The goal of this was to refine the data and use it to report back on data. I looked at which of the five boroughs seemed to have the most shootings but 
then I went and broke it up even farther to help eliminate bias.
